## üß™ `demo/` ‚Äì Internal Demo Version

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Intended **only for internal demo purposes**, not for customer distribution.

This version demonstrates the **end-to-end analytics capabilities at scale**, simulating transcription output to:
- Showcase AI enrichment (sentiment, NER, classification, summarization)
- Visualize patterns across **larger volumes of call data**
- Power the **front-end dashboard** with meaningful insights

### üîß Key Notes:
- Includes **sample audio files** in the Bronze layer.
- Uses **`resources/generate_data.py`** to create a **Silver layer** with **simulated transcriptions**.
- Supports **bulk application** of Databricks AI Functions (sentiment, summarization, topic classification, etc.).
- Ideal for **live demos** and showcasing **dashboard interactivity**.

### üß© Use Case:
Great for illustrating how insights scale when applying AI functions across calls in a customer service environment.

## ü§ù `customer/` ‚Äì Shareable Version

> ‚úÖ This is the version meant to be **shared directly with customers**.

The `customer/` directory contains the **clean version of the solution accelerator**, which:
- Includes **sample `.m4a` audio files** for ingestion
- Walks through the **complete, realistic pipeline**:
  - Bronze Layer: Raw ingestion of audio
  - Silver Layer: Format conversion, duration calculation, transcription using Whisper
  - Gold Layer: AI enrichment via Databricks AI Functions and LLMs

### üîß Key Notes:
- No simulated data ‚Äî all transcriptions are generated from real sample audio using **OpenAI Whisper**.
- Ensures full **transparency and reproducibility**.
- Designed to show **how customers can adopt the pipeline** with their own audio sources and extend the AI use cases.

---

## üîç Resources

- `demo/resources/generate_data.py`: Generates simulated transcription data for demo use
- Notebooks are modular and follow **Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold)**

## üß≠ Suggested Usage

| Directory | Audience | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `demo/` | Internal teams | Live demos and showcasing dashboards at scale |
| `customer/` | Customers, prospects | Deployable reference pipeline with real transcription and AI insights |

---

## üìé Notebooks (Included in Both Versions)

| Notebook | Layer | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `00 ETL Bronze Layer` | Bronze | Ingest raw audio and register file metadata |
| `01 ETL Silver Layer` | Silver | Convert audio, extract metadata, transcribe |
| `02 ETL Gold Layer` | Gold | Apply AI Functions for sentiment, classification, summarization, NER, and generate follow-up emails |

---

## üìä Visualisation

Use the outputs from the Gold layer to power:
- Agent & Manager dashboards
- Sentiment trends
- Fraud alerts
- Case summaries and auto-generated follow-up communications

---

## üìä Dashboard JSON Template

A sample **Databricks dashboard JSON** is included in this repository for quick deployment of visualizations powered by the Gold Layer data.

### üìÑ File:
- `dashboard.json`

### üìù Instructions:
- Import this JSON into your Databricks workspace using the dashboard import UI.
- After import, **update the SQL `SELECT` statements** in the *Data* section of each dashboard tile to point to your actual schema and table (e.g., `samantha_wise.ai_claims_processing_clean.analysis_gold`).
- Ensure you have permission to access the underlying Delta tables via Unity Catalog.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This JSON is a template. It assumes table names and paths consistent with this accelerator. If you modified the table names or schema paths, you'll need to adjust the SQL accordingly after import.
